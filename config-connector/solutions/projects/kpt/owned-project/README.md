Owned Project
==================================================

# NAME

  owned-project

# SYNOPSIS

  Config Connector compatible YAML files to create
  a project in a folder, binding an IAM member
  as project owner.

# CONSUMPTION

  Fetch the package using [kpt](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/).

  `kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/config-connector/solutions/projects/kpt/owned-project owned-project`

# REQUIREMENTS

  A working Config Connector cluster using a
  service account with the following roles in
  the folder:
  - roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer
  - roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
  - roles/iam.securityAdmin

# USAGE

  Replace the
  `${BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID?}` value.
  From within this directory, run
  ```
  kpt cfg set . billing-account VALUE
  ```
  replacing `VALUE` with your billing account
  ID.

  Replace the `${FOLDER_ID?}`, `${IAM_MEMBER?}`, and `${PROJECT_ID?}` values the same way, using:
  ```
  kpt cfg set . folder-id VALUE
  kpt cfg set . iam-member VALUE
  kpt cfg set . project-id VALUE
  ```
  where the folder-id `VALUE` is the numeric folder ID of the folder to create the new project under, the iam-member `VALUE` is the fully qualified IAM name of target member, e.g. "user:me@example.com", and the project-id `VALUE` is the name you want your project to have.

  Now you can fully apply this solution.
  ```
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```
