Shared VPC Network
==================================================

# NAME

  shared-vpc

# SYNOPSIS

  Config Connector YAML files to create a VPC network inside a
  host project to be consumed from within a service project.

## Consumption

  Download the package using [kpt](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/):
  ```
  kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit.git/config-connector/solutions/projects/kpt/shared-vpc .
  ```

## Requirements

  A working cluster with Config Connector installed.

  The cnrm-system service account, which must have:
  - `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` in the target organization if service and
host projects do not yet exist, or the `owner` role in the projects if they already exist.
  - `roles/compute.xpnAdmin` in the target organization
  - `roles/billing.user` in the target billing account
  - Cloud Billing and Cloud Resource Manager APIs enabled in the project managed by Config Connector

## Usage
  Set the ID for billing account, host project, service project, and organization:
  ```
  kpt cfg set . billing-account VALUE
  kpt cfg set . host-project VALUE
  kpt cfg set . service-project VALUE
  kpt cfg set . org-id VALUE
  ```
  Set the default namespace setter to reflect the namespace you will apply the solution YAMLs to. This may be the namespace you set [here](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/how-to/setting-default-namespace).
  ```
  kpt cfg set . default-namespace VALUE
  ```
  where `VALUE` is the name of the namespace you found to be applicable above.

  _Optionally,_ you can also change the name of the VPC network, from the default value of `sharedvpcnetwork`.

  Once your configuration is complete, simply apply:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

  Note: To see the applied resources for a given namespace, run `kubectl get gcp --namespace <namespace>`, where `<namespace>` is replaced by the corresponding namespace in the `0-namespace.yaml` file. Services that have been applied will have type `gcpservice`.
