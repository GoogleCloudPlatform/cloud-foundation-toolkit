# Cloud Foundation Toolkit Project

## Overview

The Cloud Foundation toolkit (henceforth, CFT) includes the following parts:

- A comprehensive set of production-ready Terraform blueprints that follow
  Google's best practices. See https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/blueprints/terraform-blueprints for a complete list.
- A command-line interface (henceforth, CLI) that provides developer tooling for creating and managing Terraform blueprints.
- For the latest Config Connector blueprints, refer to https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/blueprints. Older DM and Config Connector templates can be found in [previous releases](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/tree/v0.5.2).

You can see a comparison between CFT and Fabric [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/blob/master/FABRIC-AND-CFT.md).
