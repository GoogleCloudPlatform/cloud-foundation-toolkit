# Dear CFT User! 

If you are looking to build new GCP infrastructure, we recommend that you use [Terraform CFT modules](https://g.co/dev/terraformfoundation)
Terraform CFT supports the most recent GCP resources, reflects GCP best practices can be used off-the-shelf to quickly build a repeatable enterprise-ready foundation.
Additionally, if you are a looking to manage your GCP resources through Kubernetes, consider using [Config Connector CFT solutions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/tree/master/config-connector/solutions).

# Cloud Foundation Toolkit Project

## Overview

The Cloud Foundation toolkit (henceforth, CFT) includes the following parts:

- A comprehensive set of production-ready resource templates that follow
  Google's best practices, which can be used with the CFT or the gcloud
  utility (part of the Google Cloud SDK) - see
  [the template directory](templates/README.md)
- A command-line interface (henceforth, CLI) that deploys resources defined in
  single or multiple CFT-compliant config files - see:
  - The CFT source Python files (the `src/` directory)
  - The [CFT User Guide](docs/userguide.md)

In addition, the CFT repository includes a sample pipeline that enables running
CFT deployment operations from Jenkins - see the
[pipeline directory](pipeline/README.md).
