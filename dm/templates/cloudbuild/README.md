This template creates a Google Cloud Build.

## Prerequisites

- Install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)

- Enable the following in the [APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) section of the Google Cloud console:
  - [Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudbuild.googleapis.com)
  - [Cloud Source Repositories API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sourcerepo.googleapis.com)
  - [Container Registry API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/containerregistry.googleapis.com)
- Grant to the Cloud Build service account the IAM roles necessary for the steps in your build

## Deployment

### Resources

- [projects.builds](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/projects.builds)
- [cloud builders](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/cloud-builders)

### Properties

    ```

2. Go to the [dm](../../) directory

    ```shell
    cd dm
    ```

3. Copy the example DM config to be used as a model for the deployment, in this case [examples/cloudbuild.yaml](examples/cloudbuild.yaml)

    ```shell
    cp templates/cloudbuild/examples/cloudbuild.yaml my_cloudbuild.yaml
    ```

4. Change the values in the config file to match your specific GCP setup.
   Refer to the properties in the schema files described above.
