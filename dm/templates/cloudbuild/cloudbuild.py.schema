          description: |
            The list of environment variable definitions to be used when 
            running a step. The elements are in the "KEY=VALUE" form,

        args:
          type: array
          description: |
            The list of build arguments to be passed to the step when
            it is started. If the image used to run the step's container has an
            entry point, the array elements are used as arguments to that entry
            point. If the image does not define an entry point, the first
            element in the array is used as the entry point, and the remainder
            are used as arguments.

          description: |
            The working directory to use when running the step's container.
            If the value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's
            working directory. If this value is an absolute path, it may be 
            outside the build's working directory. In this case, the contents
            of the path may not be persisted across the build step executions,
            unless a volume for that path is specified.
            If the build specifies a RepoSource with dir and a step with a dir,
            which specifies an absolute path, the RepoSource dir is ignored
            for the step's execution.

            This build step will not start until all the build steps in waitFor
            have completed successfully. If waitFor is empty, this build step
            will start when all the previous build steps in the Build.Steps
            list have completed successfully.

            default entry point. If not set, the image's default entry 
            point is used.
