  title: Cloud Function
  author: Sourced Group Inc.
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Creates a Cloud Function from a local file system, a Cloud Storage bucket, 
    or a cloud source repository, and then assigns HTTPS, Storage, or Pub/Sub 
    trigger to that Cloud Function.

    For more information on this resource:
    https://cloud.google.com/functions/

    APIs endpoints used by this template:
    - gcp-types/cloudfunctions-v1:projects.locations.functions =>
        https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.functions
    - gcp-types/cloudbuild-v1:cloudbuild.projects.builds.create =>
        https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/projects.builds/create

    APIs that should be enabled (on the seed project as well):
    - cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
    - cloudbuild.googleapis.com

    Additionally, ID@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com service account of the seed project should have
    storage.buckets.create on the target project.

properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: The function name. Resource name would be used if omitted.
  project:
    type: string
    description: |
      The project ID of the project containing the Cloud function. The
      Google apps domain is prefixed if applicable.
  region:
    type: string
    description: The region where the function is deployed. Deprecated, use "location" field
  location:
    type: string
    description: The location where the function is deployed.
  timeout:
    type: string
    description: The timeout for the function, in seconds; e.g., '120s'.
    default: 60s
  runtime:
    name: string
    description: |
      The runtime in which the function is going to run. See 
      https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec#runtimes.

      - nodejs10
      - python37
    default: nodejs10
  availableMemoryMb:
    type: integer
    description: The amount of memory available for the function, MB.
    default: 256
  entryPoint:
    type: string
    description: |
      The function name (as defined in the source code) to be executed.
      Defaults to the resource name's suffix.
  sourceUploadUrl:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Google Cloud Storage signed URL used for source uploading, generated by
      [google.cloud.functions.v1.GenerateUploadUrl][]
  localUploadPath:
    type: string
    description: |
      The partial or complete path. If defined, all imported files that
      start with this path are treated as function source code, archived
      and then uploaded to Google Storage. The destination URL is either
      taken from the sourceArchiveUrl property or auto-generated. If
      the target bucket does not exist, it is created.
  sourceArchiveUrl:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL of the archive containing the Cloud Function's source code
      in Google Storage, starting with gs://, pointing to the zip archive which contains the function.
      When used along with localUploadPath, this is the path to which the source code is uploaded. If the URL points
      to a non-existing bucket, the bucket is created automatically.
  sourceRepository:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    description: |

      url:
        type: string
        description: |
          The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function is defined. There are supported Cloud Source
          Repository URLs in the following formats:

            https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/moveable-aliases/*/paths/*
            In particular, to refer to HEAD use master moveable alias.
          To refer to a specific fixed alias (tag):
            https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/fixed-aliases/*/paths/*

          You may omit paths/* if you want to use the main directory.
