  title: Cloud Function
  author: Sourced Group Inc.
  description: |
    Creates a Cloud Function from a local file system, a Cloud Storage bucket, 
    or a cloud source repository, and then assigns HTTPS, Storage, or Pub/Sub 
    trigger to that Cloud Function.

additionalProperties: false

required:
  - region

properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: The function name.
  region:
    type: string
    description: The region where the function is deployed.
  timeout:
    type: string
    description: The timeout for the function, in seconds; e.g., '120s'.
    default: 60s
  runtime:
    name: string
    description: |
      The runtime in which the function is going to run. See 
      https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec#runtimes.
    enum:
      - nodejs6
      - nodejs8
      - python37
    default: nodejs6
  availableMemoryMb:
    type: integer
    description: The amount of memory available for the function, MB.
    default: 256
  entryPoint:
    type: string
    description: |
      The function name (as defined in the source code) to be executed.
      Defaults to the resource name's suffix.
  localUploadPath:
    type: string
    description: |
      The partial or complete path. If defined, all imported files that 
      start with this path are treated as function source code, archived 
      and then uploaded to Google Storage. The destination URL is either 
      taken from the sourceArchiveUrl property or auto-generated. If
      the target bucket does not exist, it is created.
  sourceArchiveUrl:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL of the archive containing the Cloud Function's source code
      in Google Storage. When used along with localUploadPath, 
      this is the path to which the source code is uploaded. If the URL points 
      to a non-existing bucket, the bucket is created automatically.
  sourceRepositoryUrl:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL of the cloud source repository pointing to the function source code.
      E.g., https://source.developers.google.com/projects/PROJET_NAME/repos/REPO_NAME/moveable-aliases/BRANCH_NAME/paths/SUBPATH.
      See more at https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.functions.
  triggerTopic:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Pub/Sub topic name (projects/PROJECT_NAME/topics/TOPIC_NAME) that
      triggers the Cloud Function. If neither triggerTopic nor triggerStorage are
      provided, the function is triggered by an HTTPS call. See more at
      https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/events-triggers#events.
  triggerStorage:
    type: object
    description: |
      Configures the Cloud Storage trigger for the function. If neither triggerTopic
      nor triggerStorage are provided, the function is triggered by an HTTPS call.
      See more at https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/events-triggers#events.
    required:

      - event
    properties:
      bucketName:
        type: string
