    hasExternalIp:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: |
        Defines wether the instance will use an external IP from a shared
        ephemeral IP address pool. If this is set to false, the instance
        will not have an external IP.
    natIP:
      type: string
      description: |
        An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused
        static external IP address available to the project or leave this field
        undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you
        specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region
        as the zone of the instance.
        If hasExternalIp is false this field is ignored.
    subnetwork:
      type: string
      description: |
        The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the network
        resource is in legacy mode, do not provide this property. If the network
        is in auto subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is optional. If the
        network is in custom subnet mode, then this field should be specified.
        If you specify this property, you can specify the subnetwork as a full
        or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:
          - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
          - regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
    networkIP:
      type: string
      description: |
        An IPv4 internal network address to assign to the instance for this
        network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP
        is assigned by the system.
