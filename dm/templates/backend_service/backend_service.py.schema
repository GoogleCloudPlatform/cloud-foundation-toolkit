          The maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request is
          considered fresh. After this time period, the response is
          revalidated before being served. When serving responses to the signed URL
          requests, Cloud CDN internally behaves as if all responses
          from the backend have the "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header,
          regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers
          served in responses are not altered.
