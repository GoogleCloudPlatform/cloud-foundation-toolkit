  router:
    type: string
    description: |
      URL of the Cloud Router to be used for dynamic routing. This router must be in the same region as this
      InterconnectAttachment. The InterconnectAttachment will automatically connect the Interconnect to the
      network & region within which the Cloud Router is configured.

      Authorization requires the following Google IAM permission on the specified resource router:
      - compute.routers.use

  bandwidth:
    type: string
    description: |
      Provisioned bandwidth capacity for the interconnect attachment. For attachments of type DEDICATED,
      the user can set the bandwidth. For attachments of type PARTNER, the Google Partner that is operating
      the interconnect must set the bandwidth.
      Output only for PARTNER type, mutable for PARTNER_PROVIDER and DEDICATED.

      Determines whether this Attachment will carry packets. Not present for PARTNER_PROVIDER.
  partnerMetadata:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    description: |
      Informational metadata about Partner attachments from Partners to display to customers.
      Output only for for PARTNER type, mutable for PARTNER_PROVIDER, not available for DEDICATED.
    properties:
      partnerName:
        type: string
        description: |

      interconnectName:
        type: string
        description: |
          Plain text name of the Interconnect this attachment is connected to, as displayed in the Partner’s portal.
          For instance "Chicago 1". This value may be validated to match approved Partner values.
      portalUrl:
        type: string
        description: |
          URL of the Partner’s portal for this Attachment. Partners may customise this to be a deep link to the
          specific resource on the Partner portal. This value may be validated to match approved Partner values.
  vlanTag8021q:
    type: number
    description: |
      The IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag for this attachment, in the range 2-4094. Only specified at creation time.
  interconnect:
    type: string
    description: |
      URL of the underlying Interconnect object that this attachment's traffic 
      will traverse through.

      Authorization requires the following Google IAM permission on the specified resource interconnect:
      - compute.interconnects.use
  partnerAsn:
    type: string
    description: |
      Optional BGP ASN for the router supplied by a Layer 3 Partner if they configured BGP on behalf of the customer.

  candidateSubnets:
    type: array
    uniqItems: True
    description: |
      Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation of cloudRouterIpAddress and
      customerRouterIpAddress for this attachment. All prefixes must be within link-local address space (169.254.0.0/16)
      and must be /29 or shorter (/28, /27, etc). Google will attempt to select an unused /29 from the supplied
      candidate prefix(es). The request will fail if all possible /29s are in use on Google’s edge.
      If not supplied, Google will randomly select an unused /29 from all of link-local space.
    maxItems: 16

      type: string
  edgeAvailabilityDomain:
    type: string
    description: |
      Desired availability domain for the attachment. Only available for type 
      PARTNER, at creation time.

      For improved reliability, customers should configure a pair of attachments, one per availability domain.
      The selected availability domain will be provided to the Partner via the pairing key, so that the provisioned
      circuit will lie in the specified domain. If not specified, the value will default to AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY.
    enum:
      - AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_1
      - AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_2
      - AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY
