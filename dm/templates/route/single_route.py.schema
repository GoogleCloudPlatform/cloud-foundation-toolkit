properties:
    name:

        description: |
            Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
            and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
            [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?. The first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
            (except for the last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit.
            The last character must be a lowercase letter or digit.
            Resource name would be used if omitted.

        description: |
            An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
    network:
        type: string
        description: |
            Name of the network the route applies to.
    project:
        type: string
        description: |
            The project ID of the project containing the Route.
    routeType:
        type: string
        description: |
            The resource type that will handle the matching packets.
            Optionally you can use nextHop* attributes without specifying this field
        enum:
        - ipaddress
        - instance
        - gateway
        - vpntunnel
    tags:
        type: array
        uniqueItems: True
        minItems: 1
        description: |
            A list of instance tags to which the route applies.
        items:
            type: string
            description: An instance tag for the route.
    priority:
        type: number
        description: |
            The priority of this route. Priority is used to break ties in cases where there is more than one
            matching route of equal prefix length. In cases where multiple routes have equal prefix length, the one
            with the lowest-numbered priority value wins. The default value is 1000.
            The priority value must be from 0 to 65535, inclusive.
        default: 1000
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 65535
    destRange:
        type: string
        description: |
