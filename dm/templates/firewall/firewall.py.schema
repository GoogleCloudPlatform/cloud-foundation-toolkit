additionalProperties: false

required:
  - rules

properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The (optional) firewall name. This is only for documentation purposes and
      is used as the Deployment Manager resource name if set.
  network:
    type: string
    description: |
      The network name. Defaults to 'global/networks/default'.
  rules:
    type: array
    description: |
      An array of firewall rules as defined in the documentation:
      https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/firewalls.

      If the 'priority' field value is set in a rule, that value is used "as is".
      If the 'priority' field value is not set in the rule, the template sets
      the priority to the same value as the rule's index in the array +1000.
      For example, the priority for the first rule in the array becomes '1000', 
      for the second rule '1001', and so on. If the 'priority' field is not set in 
      any of the rules in the array, the ruleset is sorted by priority automatically. 
      We strongly advise being consistent in your use of the 'priority' field: 
      either provide or skip values in all instances throughout the ruleset.

      Example:
        - name: allow-proxy-from-inside
          allowed:
            - IPProtocol: tcp
              ports:
                - "80"
                - "443"
          description: This rule allows connectivity to HTTP proxies.
          direction: INGRESS
          sourceRanges:
            - 10.0.0.0/8
        - name: allow-dns-from-inside
          allowed:
            - IPProtocol: udp
              ports:
                - "53"
            - IPProtocol: tcp
              ports:
                - "53"
          description: This rule allows DNS queries to Google's 8.8.8.8
          direction: EGRESS
          destinationRanges:
            - 8.8.8.8/32
