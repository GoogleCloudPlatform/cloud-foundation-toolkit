# Example of the forwarding rule template usage.
#
# In this example, a global forwarding rule is created.
#
# Replace the following placeholders with valid values:
#   <FIXME:globalTarget>: a URL of a global load balancing 
#   resource to receive the matched traffic; e.g., targetHttpProxy
#   <FIXME:portRange>: a range of port numbers traffic from which 
#   must be forwarded to the target; e.g., '80, 8080'
#   <FIXME:labelName>: Name of a label
#   <FIXME:labelValue>: Value of a label
#
