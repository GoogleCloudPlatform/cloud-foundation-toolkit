  title: Forwarding Rule
  author: Sourced Group Inc.
  description: |
    Creates a forwrding rule.
    See https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rules for
    details.

additionalProperties: false

properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: The resource name.
  description:
    type: string
    description: The resource description (optional).
  region:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
      Not applicable to global forwarding rules.
  IPAddress:
    type: string
    description: |
      The IP address on behalf of which the forwarding rule serves. The
      address can be specified either by a literal IP address or by a URL
      reference to an existing Address resource.
  IPProtocol:
    type: string
    description: |
      The IP protocol to which the rule applies. If the load balancing scheme
      is INTERNAL, the valid valuse are TCP and UDP. For the INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED
      load balancing scheme, only TCP is valid.
    enum:
      - TCP
      - UDP
      - ESP
      - AH
      - SCTP
      - ICMP
  portRange:
    type: [integer,string]
    description: |
      The port range; only packets addressed to ports in that range are
      forwarded to the target. Used in conjunction with the target field
      for TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy,
      TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool, and TargetInstance. Applicable only
      when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP.
  ports:
    type: array
    description: |
      The list of ports; only packets addressed to these ports are forwarded
      to the backends configured with the forwarding rule. Used in conjunction with
      the backendService field for INTERNAL load balancing.
    items:
      type: integer
      minimum: 1
      maximum: 65535
  target:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must be located in the same region
      as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a
      global load balancing resource.
      For example: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/{targetType}/{targetName}
  loadBalancingScheme:
    type: string
    description: |
      Defines what the forwarding rule is used for.
      INTERNAL - used for Internal Network load balancing
      (TCP, UDP)
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED - used for Internal Global HTTP(S) load balancing
      EXTERNAL - used for External load balancing (HTTP(S), External
      TCP/UDP, SSL Proxy)
    enum:
     - INTERNAL
     - INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED
     - EXTERNAL
  subnetwork:
    type: string
    description: |
      The subnetwork the load-balanced IP must belong to for the forwarding rule.
      Used only for INTERNAL load balancing.
  network:
    type: string
    description: |
      The network the load-balanced IP must belong to for this forwarding rule.
      If no value is provided, the default network is used. Used only for
      INTERNAL and INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing.
  backendService:
    type: string
    description: |
      The backend service URL to receive the matched traffic.
      Used only for INTERNAL load balancing.
      For example: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{region}/backendServices/{backendName}
  ipVersion:
    type: string
    description: |
      The IP Version the forwarding rule uses. Can be
      specified only for external global forwarding rules.
    enum:
      - IPV4
      - IPV6

outputs:
  properties:
    - region:
        type: string
        description: |
          The URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
    - name:
        type: string
        description: The resource name.
    - selfLink:
        type: string
        description: The URI (SelfLink) of the forwarding rule resource.
    - IPAddress:
        type: string
        description: |
          The IP address on behalf of which the forwarding rule serves.
