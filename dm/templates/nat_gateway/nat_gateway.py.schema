  title: Highly Available NAT Gateway
  author: Sourced Group Inc.
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Supports creation of an HA NAT gateway. Internal network address
    translation (NAT) gateway instances can route traffic from internal-only
    virtual machine instances to the Internet. This allows you to use a limited
    number of external IP address to send traffic from multiple virtual machine
    instances while exposing a small set of NAT gateway virtual machines to the
    Internet.
