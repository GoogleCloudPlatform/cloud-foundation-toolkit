  access:
    type: array
    uniqueItems: true
    description: |
      An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more
      entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating
      the dataset to control who is allowed to access the data. If not 
      specified at the dataset creation time, BigQuery defines default
      dataset access for the following entities:
        access.specialGroup: projectReaders; access.role: READER
        access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role: WRITER
        access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER
        access.userByEmail: [dataset creator email]; access.role: OWNER
    items:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
        - role
      properties:
        role:
          type: string
          description: |
            An IAM role ID that should be granted to the user, group, or domain specified in this access entry.
            The following legacy mappings will be applied: OWNER <=> roles/bigquery.dataOwner
            WRITER <=> roles/bigquery.dataEditor READER <=> roles/bigquery.dataViewer This field will accept any of
            the above formats, but will return only the legacy format. For example, if you set this field to
            "roles/bigquery.dataOwner", it will be returned back as "OWNER". @mutable bigquery.datasets.update
        domain:
          type: string
          description: |
            The domain to grant access to. All users signed in with the 
            specified domain are granted the corresponding access.
            Example: "example.com".
        userByEmail:
          type: string
          description: |
            The email address of a user to grant access to. For example:
            fred@example.com.
        groupByEmail:
          type: string
          description: The email address of a Google Group to grant access to.
        specialGroup:
          type: string
          description: |
            The special group to grant access to. Possible values include:
              projectOwners: owners of the enclosing project
              projectReaders: readers of the enclosing project
              projectWriters: writers of the enclosing project
              allAuthenticatedUsers: all authenticated BigQuery users
        view:
          type: object
          additionalProperties: false
          description: |
            A view from a different dataset to grant access to. Queries
            executed against that view have the Read access to tables in that
            dataset. The Role value is not required when this field is set. If
            the view is updated, access to that view must be granted again 
            via an Update operation.
          properties:
            datasetId:
              type: string
              description: The ID of the dataset containing the table.
            projectId:
              type: string
              description: The ID fo the project containing the table.
            tableId:
              type: string
              pattern: ^[0-9a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_]{4,1023}$
              description: |
                The table ID. The ID must contain only letters
                (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum
                length is 1,024 characters.
  setDefaultOwner:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Defines whether the default project service is granted the IAM owner 
      permissions.
  defaultTableExpirationMs:
    type: string
    format: int64
    description: |
      The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The
      minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). Once this property is
      set, all newly-created tables in the dataset get their expirationTime
      property set to the creation time plus the value of this property. 
      Changes to the value affect only new tables, not the existing ones. When
      expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table is deleted 
      automatically. If a table's expirationTime is modified or
      removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit
      expirationTime while creating the table, that value takes precedence over
      the default expiration time indicated by this property.
    minimum: 3600000
  defaultPartitionExpirationMs:
    type: string
    format: int64
    description: |
      The default partition expiration for all partitioned tables in the dataset, in milliseconds.
      Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have an expirationMs
      property in the timePartitioning settings set to this value, and changing the value will only affect new tables,
      not existing ones. The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
      Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs for partitioned tables: only one of
      defaultTableExpirationMs and defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned table.
      If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when creating or updating a partitioned table,
      that value takes precedence over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.
  labels:
    type: object
    description: |
      Map labels associated with this dataset.
      Example:
        name: wrench
        mass: 1.3kg
        count: 3

outputs:
  properties:
    - selfLink:
        type: string
        description: The URI of the created resource.
    - etag:
        type: string
        description: The hash of the resource.
    - creationTime:
        type: string
        description: |
          The time when the dataset was created, in milliseconds since
          epoch. For example, 1535739430.
    - lastModifiedTime:
        type: string
        description: |
          The time when the dataset or any of its tables was last
          modified, in milliseconds since the epoch. For example,
          1535739430.
