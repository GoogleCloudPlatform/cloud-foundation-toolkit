    type: array
    description: |
      An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more
      entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating
      the dataset to control who is allowed to access the data. If not 
      specified at the dataset creation time, BigQuery defines default
      dataset access for the following entities:
        access.specialGroup: projectReaders; access.role: READER
        access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role: WRITER
        access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER

      role:
        type: string
        description: |
          The role (rights) granted to the user specified by the other
          member of the access object. The following string values are

          https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control.

            The domain to grant access to. All users signed in with the 
            specified domain are granted the corresponding access.
            Example: "example.com".
        - userByEmail:
          type: string
          description: |
            The email address of a user to grant access to. For example:
            fred@example.com.

        - view:
          type: object
          description: |
            A view from a different dataset to grant access to. Queries
            executed against that view have the Read access to tables in that
            dataset. The Role value is not required when this field is set. If
            the view is updated, access to that view must be granted again 
            via an Update operation.
          properties:
            datasetId:
              type: string
              description: The ID of the dataset containing the table.
            projectId:
              type: string
              description: The ID fo the project containing the table.
            tableId:
              type: string
              pattern: ^[0-9a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_]{4,1023}$
              description: |
                The table ID. The ID must contain only letters
                (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum
                length is 1,024 characters.
  description:
    type: string
    description: A user-friendly description of the dataset.
  setDefaultOwner:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Defines whether the default project service is granted the IAM owner 
      permissions.
  defaultTableExpirationMs:
    type: string
    format: int64
    description: |
      The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The
      minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). Once this property is
      set, all newly-created tables in the dataset get their expirationTime
      property set to the creation time plus the value of this property. 
      Changes to the value affect only new tables, not the existing ones. When
      expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table is deleted 
      automatically. If a table's expirationTime is modified or
      removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit
      expirationTime while creating the table, that value takes precedence over
      the default expiration time indicated by this property.
    minimum: 3600000
