  hasExternalIp:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |
      Defines wether the instance will use an external IP from a shared
      ephemeral IP address pool. If this is set to false, the instance
      will not have an external IP.
  natIP:
    type: string
    description: |
      An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused
      static external IP address available to the project or leave this field
      undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you
      specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region
      as the zone of the instance.
      If hasExternalIp is false this field is ignored.
  network:
    type: string
    description: |
      URL of the network resource for this instance. When creating an instance, if neither the network
      nor the subnetwork is specified, the default network global/networks/default is used;
      if the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the network is inferred.

      If you specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL.
      For example, the following are all valid URLs:

      - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/networks/network
      - projects/project/global/networks/network
      - global/networks/default
      Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the specified resource network:

      - compute.networks.use
      - compute.networks.useExternalIp
  subnetwork:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the network resource is in legacy mode,
      do not specify this field. If the network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is optional.
      If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is required.
      If you specify this field, you can specify the subnetwork as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:

      - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
      - regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
      Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the specified resource subnetwork:

      - compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp
  networkIP:
    type: string

                When creating a new instance, one of initializeParams.sourceImage or
                disks.source is required except for local SSD.

                If desired, you can also attach existing non-root persistent disks using this property.
                This field is only applicable for persistent disks.

                Note that for InstanceTemplate, specify the disk name, not the URL for the disk.

                Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the specified resource source:

                compute.disks.use
                compute.disks.useReadOnly
            deviceName:
              type: string

                tree of a Linux operating system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference
                the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.

                If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk, in the
                form persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned by Google Compute Engine.
                This field is only applicable for persistent disks.
            boot:
              type: boolean
              description: |
                Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the first partition

            initializeParams:
              type: object
              additionalProperties: false
              description: |
                Specifies the parameters for a new disk that will be created alongside the new instance.
                Use initialization parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new instance.

                This property is mutually exclusive with the source property; you can only define one or the other, but not both.
              properties:
                labels:
                  type: object
                  description: |
                    Labels to apply to this disk. These can be later modified by the disks.setLabels method.
                    This field is only applicable for persistent disks.

                    An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
                    Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

                    Authorization requires the following Google IAM permission on the specified resource labels:

                    compute.disks.setLabels
                diskName:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    Specifies the disk name. If not specified, the default is to use the name of the instance.
                    If the disk with the instance name exists already in the given zone/region,
                    a new name will be automatically generated.
                sourceImage:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    The source image to create this disk. When creating a new instance, one of
                    initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is required except for local SSD.

                    To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family name.
                    For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9 image:

                    projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9

                    Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system image:

                    projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD

                    To create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image name in the following format:

                    global/images/my-custom-image

                    You can also specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the latest version of the
                    image in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name:

                    global/images/family/my-image-family

                    If the source image is deleted later, this field will not be set.

                    Authorization requires the following Google IAM permission on the specified resource sourceImage:

                    this field decrypts the disk using the customer-supplied encryption key.

                    If you encrypt a disk using a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key again when
                    you attempt to use this resource at a later time. For example, you must provide the key when
                    you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or when you attach the disk
                    to a virtual machine instance.

                    If you do not provide an encryption key, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically
                    generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

                    Instance templates do not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys
