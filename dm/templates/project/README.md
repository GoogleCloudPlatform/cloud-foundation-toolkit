# Project

This template:

1. Creates a new project.
2. Sets a billing account for the new project
3. Sets IAM permissions in the new project
4. Turns on a set of APIs in the new project
5. Creates service accounts for the new project
6. Creates a usage export Cloud Storage bucket for the new project
7. Removed default networks, firewalls
8. Removes default Service Account
9. Creates VPC host or attached VPC service project

## Prerequisites

Following are the prerequisites for creating a project via Deployment Manager. You can perform some of the steps via the Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com/. The `gcloud` command line tool is used to deploy the configs.

`Note:` Permission changes can take up to 20 minutes to propagate. If you run commands before the propagation is completed, you may receive errors regarding the user not having permissions.

`Note:` "If you have [Shared VPC Admin role](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#enable-shared-vpc-host) at the folder level, you need to use gcloud beta or the beta API." Some version of the Project Factory is using the GA API, which means SharedVPC features may result a permission error. See [Issue #403](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/issues/403)


1. Install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).

2.  Create a project that will create and own the deployments (henceforth referred to as *DM Creation Project*). See:  https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization.
    
    `Important:` Because of the special permissions granted to the *DM Creation Project*, it should not be used for any purpose other than creating other projects.

3.  Activate the following APIs for the *DM Creation Project*:
    * Google Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API
    * Google Cloud Resource Manager API
    * Google Cloud Billing API
    * Google Identity and Access Management (IAM) API
    * Google Service Management API

    You may use the `gcloud services enable` command to do this:

    ```shell
    gcloud services enable deploymentmanager.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable servicemanagement.googleapis.com
    ```

4.  Find the *Cloud Services* service account associated with the *DM Creation Project*.

    It is formatted as `<project_number>@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com`,
    and is listed under [IAM & Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)
    in Google Cloud Console. This account is henceforth referred to as the *DM Service Account*. See https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-proj.

5.  Create an Organization node.

    If you do not already have an Organization node under which you can create
    projects, create that node following [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization).

6.  Grant the *DM Service Account* the following permissions on the Organization node:

    - `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`
    - `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`
 
    This is visible in the Cloud Console's IAM permissions in *Resource Manager -> Project Creator* and *Resource Manager -> Service Usage Admin*. See https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-proj.

7.  Create/find the *Billing Account* associated with the Organization. See: https://cloud.google.com/support/billing/. Take note of the *Billing Account*'s ID, which is formatted as follows:`00E12A-0AB8B2-078CE8`.

8.  Give the *DM Service Account* the following permissions on the *Billing Account*: `roles/billing.user`. This is visible in Cloud Console's IAM permissions in *Billing -> Billing Account User*.

9.  If the project is a VPC host or guest project, give the *DM Service Account* the following permissions: `roles/compute.xpnAdmin`.

### Properties

See the `properties` section in the schema file(s):

-  [project](project.py.schema)

### Usage

1. Clone the [Deployment Manager Samples repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit):

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit
```

2. Go to the [dm](../../) directory:

```shell
    cd dm
```

3. Copy the example DM config to be used as a model for the deployment; in this case, [examples/project_standalone.yaml](examples/project_standalone.yaml):

```shell
    cp templates/project/examples/project_standalone.yaml my_project.yaml
```

4. Change the values in the config file to match your specific GCP setup (for properties, refer to the schema files listed above):

```shell
    vim my_project.yaml  # <== change values to match your GCP setup
```

5. Create your deployment (replace <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME> with the relevant deployment name):

```shell
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME> \
        --config my_project.yaml
```

6. In case you need to delete your deployment:

```shell
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
```

## Examples

- [Standalone project](examples/project_standalone.yaml)
- [VPC host project](examples/project_vpc_host.yaml)
- [VPC consumer project](examples/project_vpc_consumer.yaml)
