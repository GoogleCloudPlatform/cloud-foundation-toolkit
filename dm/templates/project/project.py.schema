  concurrentApiActivation:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True, activates all the requested APIs concurrently.
      When set to False, the APIs are activated serially.
      Concurrent activation makes for faster deployment but could potentially
      fail the deployment exceeding the quota limits. Make sure to request
      adequate quota before using this option. Serial activation tends to be
      significantly slower.
  sharedVPC:

      property is set.
  removeDefaultVPC:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      If True, removes the default VPC that is provisioned when a project
      is created.
  removeDefaultSA:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      If True, removes the default service account. This SA is in the
