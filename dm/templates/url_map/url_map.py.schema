      Must comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter,
      and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
      which cannot be a dash.
      Resource name would be used if omitted.

      The project ID of the project containing the Cloud Router instance. The
      Google apps domain is prefixed if applicable.

  defaultService:
    type: string
    description: |
      The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to which traffic is directed if none of the
      hostRules match. If defaultRouteAction is additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites,
      etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if defaultService is specified,
      defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified.

      Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect or defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

      Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the specified resource defaultService:
      - compute.backendBuckets.use
      - compute.backendServices.use

          type: array

            The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid hostnames, except * will match any string of

            in the pattern by either - or ..

        defaultService:
          type: string
          description: |
            The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource. This will be used if none of the pathRules or
            routeRules defined by this PathMatcher are matched. For example, the following are
            all valid URLs to a BackendService resource:
            - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService
            - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService
            - global/backendServices/backendService

            If defaultRouteAction is additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take
            effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if defaultService is specified,
            defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
            Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified.
            Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect or defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

            Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the specified resource defaultService:
            - compute.backendBuckets.use

                  rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified, advanced routing actions like
                  URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if service
                  is specified, routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction
                  specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified.

                  Only one of urlRedirect, service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
