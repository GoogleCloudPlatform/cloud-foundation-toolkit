properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
      and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
      following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  project:
    type: string
    description: |
      The project ID of the project containing the Cloud Router instance. The
      Google apps domain is prefixed if applicable.
  description:
    type: string
    description: |
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
  checkIntervalSec:
    type: integer
    default: 5
    description: Defines how often (in seconds) to perform a healthcheck.
  timeoutSec:
    type: integer
    default: 5
    description: |
      Defines how long (in seconds) to wait before declaring failure.
      The timeoutSec value must be <= checkIntervalSec.
  unhealthyThreshold:
    type: integer
    default: 2
    description: |
      The number of consecutive failures after which a formerly 
      healthy instance is marked unhealthy.
  healthyThreshold:
    type: integer
    default: 2
    description: |
      The number of consecutive successes after which a formerly unhealthy
       instance is marked healthy.
  host:
    type: string
    description: |
      The value of the host header in the HTTP health check request. 
      The default value is the public IP of the host being checked.
  port:
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 65535
    description: |
      The TCP port number for the health check request.  
      The default value depends on the healthcheck type: 80 for HTTP/2 + TCP; 
        443 for HTTPS + SSL.
  healthcheckType:
    type: string
    description: The healthcheck type.
    enum:
      - HTTP
      - HTTPS
      - HTTP2
      - SSL
      - TCP
  version:
    type: string
    default: v1
    description: |
      The healthcheck version to use: Beta or V1.
      All healthcheck types, except for HTTP2, support both options.
      HTTP2 supports only Beta.
    enum:
      - beta
      - v1
  proxyHeader:
    type: string
    default: NONE
    description: |
      The type of the proxy header to append before sending data to the back 
        end.
    enum:
      - PROXY_V1
      - NONE
  requestPath:
    type: string
    default: /
    description: |
      The request path of the HTTP health check request. 
      Can only be used with HTTP + HTTPS + HTTP2 healthchecks.
  request:
    type: string
    description: |
      The application data to send once the SSL connection has been 
      established (the default value is empty). If both request and response
      are empty, the connection establishment alone indicates health. 
      The request data can only be ASCII
      Note: used only with TCP + SSL.
  response:
    type: string
    description: |
      The bytes to match against the beginning of the response data. 
      If left empty (the default value), any response will indicate health. 
      The response data can only be ASCII.
      Note: Used only with TCP + SSL except in beta. In beta, response is 
      available to all healthcheck types.
  portName:
    type: string
    description: |
      The port name as defined in InstanceGroup#NamedPort#name. If both port
      and port_name are defined, port takes precedence.
      Note: Used only in beta.
  portSpecification:
    type: string
    description: |
      Defines how port is selected for health checking. One of the
      following values:
      USE_FIXED_PORT: The port number in {port} is used for health checking.
      USE_NAMED_PORT: The {portName} is used for health checking.
      USE_SERVING_PORT: For NetworkEndpointGroup, the port specified for each
      network endpoint is used for health checking. 
      For other backends, the port or named port specified in the Backend 
      Service is used for health checking.
      If not specified, healthcheck follows behavior specified in the {port}
      and {portName} fields.
      Used only in beta for all types.
    enum:
      - USE_FIXED_PORT
      - USE_NAMED_PORT
      - USE_SERVING_PORT

  properties:
    - name:
        type: string
        description: The HealthCheck resource name.
    - selfLink:
        type: string
        description: The Deployment Manager-defined URL for the resource.
    - creationTimestamp:
        type: datetime
