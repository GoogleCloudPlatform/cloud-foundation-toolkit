# Test Case: Backward Compatibility
# Use Case:
#   You have updated CFT code base up to the latest version and now it works
#   with your old-style written templates in a slightly different way.
#
#   F.e.: `zoneName` property is now replaced by `name` to align syntax with
#   the naming convention of the API.
