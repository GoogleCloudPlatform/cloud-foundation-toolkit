# Test Case: Cross-Project Reference
# Use Case:
#   You have multiple projects with dependancies on each other.
#   Like one project assumes a presence of DNS Zone in another in order
#   to use it as an endpoint. So within your agregated pipe-line you may want
#   to provision resources in both of the projets.
#
#   Please note: you should grant Editor permission on the cross-referenced
#   Project to your current Google APIs account <PROJECT_ID>@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com
