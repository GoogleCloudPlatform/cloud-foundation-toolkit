# Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)

This template creates a Google Cloud KMS KeyRing and Keys.

## Prerequisites

- Install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)
- Create a [GCP project, set up billing, enable requisite APIs](../project/README.md)
- Grant the [cloudkms.admin](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/iam) IAM role to
  the Deployment Manager service account

## Deployment

### Resources

- [gcp-types/cloudkms-v1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/)
- [KMS Object hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/object-hierarchy)
- [KMS Key Version States](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/key-states)
- [KMS Object Lifetime](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/object-hierarchy#lifetime)

### Properties

See the `properties` section in the schema file(s):

- [Cloud KMS](kms.py.schema)

### Usage

1. Clone the [Deployment Manager samples repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit)

   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit
   ```

2. Go to the [dm](../../) directory

   ```shell
   cd dm
   ```

3. Copy the example DM config to be used as a model for the deployment,
