# Example of the Google Cloud KMS template usage.
#
# In this example, a KMS KeyRing and cryptographic key are created.
# The cryptographic key's purpose is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT by default.
# IAM Policies are applied to the cryptographic key.
#
# Replace the following placeholders with relevant values:
# <FIXME:user_account_email_address>: a valid user account email address
# <FIXME:next_rotation_time>       : Next Key Rotation time in format
