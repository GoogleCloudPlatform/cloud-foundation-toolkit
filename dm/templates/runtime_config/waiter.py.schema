properties:
  project:
    type: string
    description: |
      The project ID of the project containing resources. The
      Google apps domain is prefixed if applicable.
  parent:
    type: string
    description: |
      The path to the configuration that will own the waiter.
      The configuration must exist beforehand; the path must be in the
      projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME] format.
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the waiter resource, in the
      projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]/waiters/[WAITER_NAME] format.
      Must match the RFC 1035 segment specification. Maximum length is 64
      bytes.
  waiter:
    type: string
    description: |
      DEPRECATED, please use "name"
  config:
    type: string
    description: |
      Config resource name (for dependency)
  timeout:
    type: string
    description: |
      The timeout of the waiter in seconds, beginning from the
      instant when the waiters().create method is called; e.g., "3.5s".
      If this time elapses before the success or failure conditions are met,
      the waiter fails and sets the error code to DEADLINE_EXCEEDED.
  failure:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    description: |
      The failure condition for the waiter. If this condition is met, done is
      set to True, and the error code is set to ABORTED. The failure
      condition takes precedence over the success condition. If both conditions
      are met, the failure is indicated. This value is optional; if no
      failure condition is set, the only failure scenario is the timeout.
    properties:
      cardinality:
        type: object

        properties:
          path:
            type: string
            description: |
              The root of the variable subtree to monitor. E.g., /foo.
          number:
            type: number
            default: 1
            description: |
              The number of variables under the path that must exist to meet
              this condition. If not specified, defaults to 1.
  success:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    description: |
      The success condition. If this condition is met, done is set to True,
      and the error value remains unset. The failure condition takes
      precedence over the success condition. If both conditions are met, the
      failure is indicated.
